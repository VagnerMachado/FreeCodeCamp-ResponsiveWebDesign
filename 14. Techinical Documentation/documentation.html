<header><h3>What is Python?</h3></header>
<p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
<p>It is flexible and some usages include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>web development (server-side)</li>
    <li>software development</li>
    <li>mathematics</li>
    <li>system scripting</li>
</ol>
<h3>What can Python do?</h3>
<p>
    To cite a few of an evergrowing list of usages, Python can be used on a server to create web applications and alongside software to create workflows. It can also connect to database systems, read and modify files, and handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Lastly, Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. As described, one can see how Python is flexible to encompass a wide array of usages in modern systems. 
</p>
<h3>Why Python?</h3>
<p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc) and has a simple syntax similar to the English language. It has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written, making it a great language for prototyping. Moreover, Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>

<h3>Good to know</h3>
<p>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this sample documentation page. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</p>

<h3>Python Syntax</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
<li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
<li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python's intuitive grammar can be seen, for example, in a line of code that prints some text <code>print("Hello, World!")</code></p>
<p>Given that Python is a language with many features, writing an extensive tutorial would be a very time consumin endeavor, filled with research, trial and error, library explorations and such. With that in mind, this intro to Python aims to expose the reader to some important data types available. Happy Coding! </p>

 <header>Built in Data Types</header>
 <h3></h>
 <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
 <p>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do 
 different things.</p>
 <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
 <table>
   <tr>
     <td>Text Type:</td>
     <td><code>str</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Numeric Types:</td>
     <td><code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
     <code>complex</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Sequence Types:</td>
     <td><code>list</code>, <code>tuple</code>, 
     <code>range</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Mapping Type:</td>
     <td><code>dict</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Set Types:</td>
     <td><code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Boolean Type:</td>
     <td><code>bool</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Binary Types:</td>
     <td><code>bytes</code>, <code>bytearray</code>, 
     <code>memoryview</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>None Type:</td>
     <td><code>NoneType</code></td>
   </tr>
