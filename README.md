# README

## Purpose
This is a repository where I will add the content from FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design.
If you wish to follow the same steps, please visit https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design

The course is made up of several small projects so each one will be hosted in its folder and ordered numerically.
