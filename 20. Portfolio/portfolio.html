        <p class="description">A  Javascript and HTML application that enables users to search for X, formerly 
            Twitter, posts based by location. Using X's and Google Maps' APIs this project delivers a nice functionality with a clean UI. 
            Featuring map caching, validations, and much more.</p></div>

        <p class="description">This project explores a few data sets. In one of them, I analyze loan data to find which loans are more likely 
            to not be paid. EDA is performed and relationships are explored with a variety of plots and graphs, dummy variables are used, 
            data is split into train and test data with further cross validation to confirm results are not flawed. The models used 
            in the final project include Logistic Regressions, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifiers and Naive Bayes</p></div>

        <p class="description" >This C++ program implements a priority based preemptive scheduler where:<br>
            - Process with highest integer value has highest priority.<br>
            - Round Robin algorithm for processes with same priority.<br>
            - Round Robin has time quantum 10 time units.<br>
            - Default program output prints execution details, waiting and turnaround times for processes.</p></div>

        <p class="description">This project simulates a linear memory allocator application. The memory is initially 
            set to have its first byte at location 0 and last available memory byte is represented by the integer passed 
            as program argument during execution, minus 1. When the program loads, the user sees the prompt 'allocator >' 
            to which the user can input commands to request and release memory.</p></div>

        <p class="description">In this project, I explored HTLM and several CSS tricks and tips, such as Flex box, CSS grid, typography, transforms,
            pseudo selectors, media queries (...) to create tribute pages, magazine artilces,
            landing pages and this very own portfolio.
